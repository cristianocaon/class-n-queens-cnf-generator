# N-Queens CNF Generator

The script was developed for the class CS 5384 (Logic for Computer Scientists) from Texas Tech University.

The goal was to develop a script that automatically generates the CNF file for the N-Queens SAT problem.

## Execution

By default it can be executed for N=3:

```bash
python3 nqueen.py
```

Alternatively, the N can be changed via terminal argument, e.g., N=4:
```bash
python3 nqueen.py 4
```
